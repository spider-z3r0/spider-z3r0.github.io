<p><em>What follows is not written to be 100% accurate in all the technical detail. It is written to help people with limited knowledge of computers to get started with using python. As such, I have tried to limit jargon so if you already know terms like "object" and "class", or what a command line is, then this page ain't for you. Feel free to stick around though.</em></p>
<p>OK, now that you have <a href="">installed python and a program that lets you do python-y things</a> its time to acutally....start doing python-y things. </p>
<p>So, we're going to start with the way that you can type normal, everyday, English into python and have it recognised as such: </p>
<h2>Strings!</h2>
<p>A string is just a collection of alphanumeric text (letters and numbers and punctuation), and it's the first example of a python <strong>class</strong> we're meeting here. Now we're not going to cover classes here, it'll become clear over time, but what you need to know right now is that a class is the general name for something that python can work with. Strings are one type of class, there are many others, and eventually you'll even be able to make your own! </p>
<h3>Fine Kev, get on with it!</h3>
<p>OK, sorry! Sorry!</p>
<p>I've just told you that python has a a way dealing with normal langauge, the trick is that you have wrap that text in quotes, otherwise python doesn't know what to do with it. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s1">&#39;Check out the apostrophies at the begining and the end of this sentence!&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Boom. we have our first string! Python can read that sentence and can do stuff with it, awesome. However, let's take a look at another sentence and see if we can make a string out of it. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s1">&#39;Making strings is awesome, let&#39;</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">more</span><span class="err">!</span><span class="s1">&#39; </span>
</pre></div>


<p>See the problem? Python treats the first apostrophe as the start of the string and teh second apostrophy as the end of the string, even though it's not actually the end of the sentence. Now, we could just avoid every typing a contraction like "can't" or "didn't", and avoid Irish or Scottish surnames begining with O, but that seems like a special hell, does it not? </p>
<p>Fortunately there's a simple fix; when we want to enter a string that includes an apostrophie in the text we use double quotes <em>""</em>, standard quotation marks.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;Now ain&#39;t this a pretty string?&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Why yes python, yes it is. </p>
