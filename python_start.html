<p><em>What follows is not 100% accurate. I'm using language that makes sense to people who don't have a background in computers. I know that there are terms like "object" and "class" that are more accurate, but if you already know those terms, then this page ain't for you. Feel free to stick around though.</em></p>
<h2>Getting started in python</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is make sure that python is installed on your computer and up to date. There's a few ways to do this, and if you have a Mac it's already there, but your fastest bet is to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">anaconda</a>, which installs python and a few good programs that let you write and run code. </p>
<p>These programs are called <a href="https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/what-is-an-integrated-development-environment/"><strong>Integrated Development Environments</strong></a>, but don't worry about that right now. The short version is they let you work on projects without needing to have loads of windows open on your computer. </p>
<p>Once you have installed anaconda, open it up and you'll be presented with a grid of different "apps" (that's not the right term but we're gonna use it here) laid out in a grid. Now, you're free to use any of these apps and there's loads of reason to use each one, but I'm going to work in spyder because... well just because. I was advised to use spyder when I started out, and although I've moved on since, I'm advising you to do the same. </p>
<p>So click "launch" on the spyder app and away we go... </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/images/Spyder.png"></p>
<p>Spyder consists of 3 seperate panes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The text editor, this is where you can write and edit code. </li>
<li>The console, where your code runs (hopefully).</li>
<li>The 3rd pane, which does multiple things, like let you view your variables and plots, find files etc. It's a good pane, I like it. It's kinda why we're using spyder.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The text editor.</h3>
<p>So, I'm going to assume that you have edited text before, you've used Word, or written a facebook post/tweet? Well, in the simplest terms, the text editor is like a word page or a status box. You write in it, you can delete, jump around, copy and paste... do texty-things. In general you want to write code in here but you can include everyday language as well when you want to explain something, but we'll get to that later. What you need to take away from this is the text editor is like Word or Pages, you write your "document" (in this case some code) and can freely edit it from there. The cool thing is that you can tell the computer to read what you have written in the text editor <a href="https://spider-z3r0.github.io/python.html"><em>as a set of instructions</em></a> in the order you've written it, and the computer will do it. </p>
<p>You can get the computer to read the whole document from top to bottom, or to start in the middle, but really, you want to think of your text here like a story; it has a begining, a middle, and an end. You should be aiming to have it read like that with very little jumping around, once you've finished editing. </p>
<p>One of the first things you'll do is make things show up in the console. </p>
<h3>The Console.</h3>
<p>The console is where the magic happens. When you tell your computer to do something, the console is where your computer will tell you what's happening. So if you tell your computer to say "Hello World!", unless otherwise stated you'll see: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ss">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>in the console. </p>
<p>You can also write code dierctly into the console and when you press enter the code will run, with the output appearing directly below the code you wrote. Honestly, I don't do that often because it looks messy. However, if I want to do something just once I will jump into the console. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="err">!</span>
</pre></div>
