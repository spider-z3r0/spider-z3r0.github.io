&lt;p&gt;So, for some reason, you've decide decided that learning python would be a good thing to do. Great! I agree with you completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... of course I do or this site would be pointless... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, moving on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's really very little that you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; do with python, but unless you have been coding for a long time already then it really is best to start with the small stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What follows is not 100% accurate. I'm using language that makes sense to people who don't have a background in computers. I know that there are terms like "object" and "class" that are more accurate, but if you already know those terms, then this page ain't for you. Feel free to stick around though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working in python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is make sure that python is installed on your computer and up to date. There's a few ways to do this, and if you have a Mac it's already there, but your fastest bet is to install &lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/"&gt;anaconda&lt;/a&gt;, which installs python and a few good programs that let you write and run code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These programs are called &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/what-is-an-integrated-development-environment/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Development Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but don't worry about that right now. The short version is they let you work on projects without needing to have loads of windows open on your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have installed anaconda, open it up and you'll be presented with a grid of different "apps" (that's not the right term but we're gonna use it here) laid out in a grid. Now, you're free to use any of these apps and there's loads of reason to use each one, but I'm going to work in spyder because... well just because. I was advised to use spyder when I started out, and although I've moved on since, I'm advising you to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So click "launch" on the spyder app and away we go... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![][Spyder.png]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spyder consists of 3 seperate panes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 3rd pane, which does multiple things, like let you view your variables and plots, find files etc. &lt;/li&gt;

I won't bore you with the details of my life but I will say that you are welcome and I hope you find something here that is useful to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site has a two-fold moral purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To document my journey into &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; and programming in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help others if I can. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is, the more I worked with &lt;strong&gt;SPSS&lt;/strong&gt; the more frustrated I became with it. Being of a technical bent, I decided to take the plunge and start using the little bit of programming knowledge I had to escape the monotony of working with SPSS. Between one thing and another I decided that I would learn python and make that my tool of choice, and with a few weeks I was completely sold to the point of evangelising it where ever I could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I completed a few data projects with python, wrote a few scripts, read a few books and the people around me were pretty impressed by the results, but, I kept coming up against the same issue time and again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"I'm not technical enough to do that, it's cool though..."&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know these people, they are much smarter than me, more diligent, and they can all spell betterer, so I decided there must be something I can do to help that isn't another long rant about how much better things are with just a few lines of code inder your belt. If you can write a letter, or a post-it or an &lt;em&gt;academic paper&lt;/em&gt; you can definitely write code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thus, this site.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to give introductions to tools like python, git, and markdown that will genuinely make lifes easier, and to do so in language that humans will understand. It won't be the "&lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;" version because there are much smarter people out there than me, but one of the things I've noticed while learning from those people is that they tend to take some steps for granted, steps that are obvious. The problem is that when you start out they're really not obvious and they can easily leave you feeling like an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don't mind feeling like an idiot and I have a healthy dose of background rage that helps me to push past that feeling until I can get something to work. I also really enjoy teaching, I love that feeling you get when something clicks into place, and I love seeing that "a-ha" look something clicks for someone else. For that reason I like breaking things down to find the bit that experts forget to tell you because it's "obvious". It's normally that bit that keeps people stuck, and when thats the case it takes someone making it explicite and then some amount of practice before its "obvious" to you too. My aim here is to try to make that whole loop more enjoyable by taking the bits that were hidden by obviousness and pointing them out where I can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a full plan going in, but I do have an idea, so I'm just going to run with that. If you want to you can run along beside me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are interested stick around. If you're not then that's ok too but I hope that you do start using python and some of the &lt;a href="hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; out there that let you go beyond Word, Excel, and SPSS becuase life's way more fun over here. &lt;/p&gt;
