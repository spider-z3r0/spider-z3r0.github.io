<p><em>What follows is not written to be 100% accurate in all the technical detail. It is written to help people with limited knowledge of computers to get started with using python. As such, I have tried to limit jargon so if you already know terms like "object" and "class", or what a command line is, then this page ain't for you. Feel free to stick around though.</em></p>
<p>You now know how to <a href="">make strings like a boss</a>, meaning that when it comes to typing the language you use in everyday life you have the basics under your belt. What we're moving onto now is something that comes to mind more often when people think of computers:</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>Don't worry, we're not getting into complex maths, we're just going get used to playing with simple numbers in python. </p>
<h3>Ints</h3>
<p>The first way that python handles numbers is as the "int" type. This is basically just a whole number like 9 or 42(hehe) or 7000000000, the way you use numbers every day as you go through your life, doing numbery things... like counting "likes"... or what ever it is you people do.</p>
<h3>Floats</h3>
<p>The other way that python works with numbers is as floating-point numbers, of the "float" type. Just like ints, floats are pretty simple, they're just numbers followed by a decimal point. So 13.333333 is a float, and so is 0.2 etc. You know the deal. </p>
<h3>Telling the difference</h3>
<p>Hopefully, you remember that when using normal langauge in python you use quotation marks to tell python what it is.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;Like this. Python knows that this is a string.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With numbers however, python just knows what's hap'nin. This means you can just give python a number and every math instructions and python will give you back the result (again, we're taking it really slowly, you can do more than that). The usual math symbols, like + and - work just fine so lets just start there. </p>
