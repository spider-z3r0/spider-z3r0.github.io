<p>So, for some reason, you've decide decided that learning python would be a good thing to do. Great! I agree with you completely. </p>
<p>Well... of course I do or this site would be pointless... </p>
<p>OK, moving on. </p>
<p>There's really very little that you <em>can't</em> do with python, but unless you have been coding for a long time already then it really is best to start with the small stuff. </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p><em>What follows is not 100% accurate. I'm using language that makes sense to people who don't have a background in computers. I know that there are terms like "object" and "class" that are more accurate, but if you already know those terms, then this page ain't for you. Feel free to stick around though.</em></p>
<h2>Working in python</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is make sure that python is installed on your computer and up to date. There's a few ways to do this, and if you have a Mac it's already there, but your fastest bet is to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">anaconda</a>, which installs python and a few good programs that let you write and run code. </p>
<p>These programs are called <a href="https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/what-is-an-integrated-development-environment/"><strong>Integrated Development Environments</strong></a>, but don't worry about that right now. The short version is they let you work on projects without needing to have loads of windows open on your computer. </p>
<p>Once you have installed anaconda, open it up and you'll be presented with a grid of different "apps" (that's not the right term but we're gonna use it here) laid out in a grid. Now, you're free to use any of these apps and there's loads of reason to use each one, but I'm going to work in spyder because... well just because. I was advised to use spyder when I started out, and although I've moved on since, I'm advising you to do the same. </p>
<p>So click "launch" on the spyder app and away we go... </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/images/Spyder.png"></p>
<p>Spyder consists of 3 seperate panes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The text editor</li>
<li>The console</li>
<li>The 3rd pane, which does multiple things, like let you view your variables and plots, find files etc. </li>
</ol>                </article>
