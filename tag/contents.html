</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Welcome to my series of python articles for <strong>absolute beginers</strong>. The articles below are designed to help people with no experience (other than using a computer) to get started with programming, and particularly with python. They are written with the aim of helping people coming from a social science background to transition  away from programs like SPSS and MS Excel and so a lot of the examples are childishly simple, especially in the earlier articles. </p>
<p>This page will always have the articles in order and will be updated when ever a new post is made so as to always be the front page of the python section of this website. I hope you find something useful to you here, or something that may be useful to someone else. If you are new to python, I'm sure you will enjoy the journey. Just be patient and remember that its OK if you need a few tutorials before something clicks; new skills take lots of practice. If you're a seasoned python data scientist, then please look on this site with a kind eye, my aim has been to break everything down so that nothing is taken for granted or assumed because I found that to be a really common problem with the majority of online python teaching content. At least with the free stuff anyway. </p>
<p>No matter who you are, please use this site as you see fit, and if it is of use to you please consider sharing it with others.</p>
